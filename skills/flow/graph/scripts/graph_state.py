"""Plan and checkpoint a /graph task graph.

Dependency cycles, dangling edges, scope collisions, wave layering and the
checkpoint transitions are deterministic. Deriving them in prose every wave is
slower and less reliable, so they live here and the skill says "run this and
read the summary".

Subcommands:

  plan [--nodes <file>] [--state .graph_state.json] [--max-parallel N] [--keep-shipped] [--only-pending]
      Read a nodes file, validate it, layer it into waves, write the checkpoint,
      and print the plan (human summary + Mermaid + the wave-0 dispatch list).
      Without --nodes the graph is rebuilt from the checkpoint itself, which holds
      every declarative field a plan reads; the nodes file is then needed only when
      the graph changes (a new node, a moved dependency). The first plan of a graph
      still needs --nodes, because there is no checkpoint to re-layer from yet.
      With --keep-shipped, an existing checkpoint's per-node outcome is carried
      over for every id that survives, so a re-plan does not reset what shipped.
      With --only-pending, nodes a previous checkpoint already settled (shipped
      or skipped) stop reserving their scope, so remaining work may share a wave
      with them. Their files are already on the branch; only a node still running
      can collide with them. Nodes the checkpoint has in_progress keep their
      scope and are layered ahead of pending work that shares it, so a re-plan
      never dispatches a child into files another child is editing right now.
      Pair it with --keep-shipped, which is what puts the settled outcomes in
      place to read.
      The cap is persisted: omitting --max-parallel on a later plan reuses the
      recorded one instead of silently re-layering the waves.

  set --state .graph_state.json --node N --status <s> [--commit SHA] [--branch NAME] [--error TEXT]
      Record one node's outcome, and optionally the branch it actually lives on.
      Pass --status pending to clear a retry. Prints what the orchestrator should
      do next.

  show --state .graph_state.json [--json]
      Print the current plan and per-node status.

  prompt --node N [--state .graph_state.json] [--worktrees DIR]
      Render the node prompt for one node from references/node-prompt.md, with
      the worktree path, branch, title, type, scope and acceptance criteria
      filled in from the checkpoint. A `branch` recorded by `plan` or `set` is
      used verbatim; only an unrecorded node gets a name derived from its title,
      and then the header says so. The worktree command printed first matches
      what the prompt claims about the branch — including whether it exists.
      The dependency summaries are left as a marked gap — only the orchestrator
      knows them.

Nodes file format:

  {
    "task": "Add user auth",
    "repo": "owner/repo",
    "max_parallel": 4,
    "nodes": [
      {"id": 1, "title": "db schema", "deps": [], "scope": "internal/db",
       "criteria": ["migration applies on a fresh database"]},
      {"id": 2, "title": "API handler", "deps": [1], "scope": "internal/api",
       "hot_files": "internal/api/router.go", "branch": "feat/issue-42-api",
       "context": "#1 landed migration 012; the table already exists."}
    ]
  }

`criteria` is the node's acceptance checklist, copied into the child's prompt
verbatim. `context` is the orchestrator's briefing for the child: one or two
lines per dependency — what it added, where, and anything the node must know.
Both may also be written straight into the checkpoint. A re-plan keeps the
checkpoint's value only for a field the nodes file does not mention; an explicit
empty list/string in the nodes file clears it (presence decides, not truthiness).

`scope` is a comma-separated list of files/directories a node expects to touch.
Two nodes with no dependency edge but overlapping scope are not independent:
the planner serializes the higher id into a later wave.

`hot_files` is the opposite list: shared wiring files (a router, a `main`, a
route table, a DI container, a type union) that the node *will* touch but that
must stay out of `scope`, because listing them there would serialize the whole
graph into a chain. The planner does not serialize on them — it warns when two
nodes in one wave declare the same hot file, because that is the shape that
conflicts: "append-only edits merge cleanly" only holds while each node edits
its own region. Two nodes appending to one import block, or writing one route
table, are not append-only and will conflict at integration.

`branch` (optional, per node) is the branch the node actually lives on. When it
is absent the checkpoint records none and `prompt` derives a name from the
title, disclosing that it did; a node whose real branch differs from the derived
name should have it recorded, or `prompt` will hand the child a name that does
not exist.

Statuses: pending | in_progress | shipped | failed | blocked | skipped
(`shipped` and `skipped` are complete; `failed` and `blocked` stall their
dependents but do not hold a wave open forever — the orchestrator decides.)

    A single greedy pass, because the two constraints interact — a node held back
    for a scope clash must not jump ahead of its own dependencies, and its
    dependents must not land in the same wave as it. Only nodes whose deps are
    already placed are candidates, so ordering holds by construction; a candidate
    that clashes on scope simply waits for a later wave.

    `settled` names nodes that are already finished (shipped or skipped). They are
    still placed, so the layout keeps their positions and their dependents keep
    their ordering, but they reserve no scope: a scope clash only matters between
    two nodes that could run at the same time, and a settled node has already
    landed on the branch. Without this, re-planning mid-run lets long-finished
    nodes hold their files against the work that is actually left, which silently
    serializes the tail of a graph into one node per wave.

    `inflight` names nodes that are running right now. They are placed before
    equally-ready pending nodes, because that tie used to be broken by id alone —
    and id order runs the wrong way here. A running node is usually the reason the
    nodes sharing its files are still pending, and those nodes have the lower id
    about half the time, so they would be layered *ahead* of the work they were
    waiting on and dispatched into a file another child is editing at that moment.

    That collision is recorded as an edge rather than filtered inside the wave
    loop. Filtering deadlocks: the pending node waits for a running node whose own
    dependencies are not placed yet, no candidate survives, and the graph is
    reported as a cycle. As an edge the layering places the running node first
    wherever its dependencies allow, and its colliding dependents follow — which
