# DSH runtime notes for /graph

Read this when a wave misbehaves, when you are about to spawn nodes, or when you need the
exact mechanics. The body of the skill assumes these facts; this file is where they live so
the body stays short.

## Delegation

`subagent` starts a **fresh** child that does not see this conversation; `subagent_fork` is the
variant that inherits it. Calls run in the background by default and return a durable child id
immediately, so **several `subagent` calls in one assistant message are concurrent**. A
background child reports back through a **settlement notice** — never poll for it, never
busy-wait; when the notice arrives, that node is done.

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Start a node | `subagent` (fresh context) |
| Start N nodes at once | N `subagent` calls in **one** assistant message |
| Wave barrier | wait for every node's settlement notice |
| Audit the tree | `list_agents(scope="descendants")` |
| Retry / continue a node | `send_message(child_id, ...)` |
| Kill a stuck node | `interrupt_agent(child_id)` |
| Long build or test inside a node | background jobs (`job_*`) |
| Wave progress | `todo_write`, and `present` for `graph.html` |

## The two traps, in DSH terms

The body states the harness-independent facts; this is how they bite in DSH:

1. **Relative paths.** `read` / `write` / `edit` resolve a *relative* path against the calling
   session's cwd — the main checkout, not the caller's worktree. A node that writes
   `internal/foo.go` writes into the shared tree. **Inside a node, always pass absolute paths
   under its worktree.**
2. **Fresh shells.** `cd` does not persist between calls. Pass `workdir=<abs worktree>`, or
   prefix `cd <abs worktree> && …` in the same command. A bare `go test ./...` runs in the main
   checkout.

The orchestrator's own leak check (`git status --porcelain` on the shared checkout before
merging) is what proves the discipline held.

## Depth, concurrency, cost

- **Depth.** Delegation depth is capped at **1** by default, so a node — depth 1 — cannot delegate
  at all. Say so in the node prompt: a node that needs a second level of work does it itself.
- **Concurrency.** The host caps how many tool calls overlap in one step (ten by default), and the
  runtime separately bounds how many continuable children one parent may hold. The wave cap (Step 2
  of the skill, default 3–4) is the brake you actually control, so enforce it yourself.
- **Cost shape.** A fresh child joins the parent's composition, so it receives the *same* system
  prompt, the *same* full tool schemas and the *same* skill catalog; none of that is trimmed by
  depth, and no token budget exists — round counts are the only bound. Only the deployment can
  trim a child (`toolFilter` / `persona` on the subagent row are plugin config, not skill
  fields; the model-facing `subagent` tool takes no such argument). Every child therefore pays
  that fixed overhead for its whole life, which is why this skill ends a node at "committed"
  instead of extending it into review and shipping, and why trivial work belongs inline in the
  orchestrator rather than in a node.
  A deployment *can* hand nodes a cheaper child: `toolFilter.deny: [skill]` on a second
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-subagent` row removes that child's catalog and loader outright, because
  the catalog is visibility-matched to the `skill` tool. `references/lean-subagent.md` has the
  paste-ready patch, the measured saving and the caveats — read it before promising a saving.
- **Model routing (opt-in, off by default).** If the deployment enabled the host
  `subagent-model-selection` setting, `subagent` also accepts `provider`, `model` and
  `reasoning_effort`, and `list_subagent_models` appears. When those fields are absent from the
  schema they are not available — every node inherits the parent's route. Do not plan around
  routing you cannot see.

## `/goal` and other skills

`/goal` is a DSH **command**, not a skill: typing it is a human action. The model side of the
same surface is the goal tools (`create_goal` / `update_goal`), and their gate is **authority,
not wording**: `create_goal` only runs in a **direct top-level human turn** — a node child, whose
authority is a subagent's, cannot mint a long-horizon goal for itself, and neither can the
orchestrator mid-wave. That does not mean waiting for the word "goal": when the human hands over a
long-running objective ("run this whole graph"), creating the goal *is* the designed behaviour, and
it is what keeps the session working between waves. `edit` / `pause` / `resume` carry the same
restriction; `complete` / `blocked` are also allowed during this goal's own rounds. A graph run is
exactly that case: the goal drives the session, `.graph_state.json` remembers the layout — two
different things, two different counters.

"Implement" always means the node child writes the code. `/review-it` and `/ship-it` ARE real
skills and are callable — by the orchestrator, once per wave.

`<SKILL_DIR>` in commands is defined once in `SKILL.md`: this skill's own directory (absolute).
DSH prepends a resource block on every skill load (`<skill_resources>` /
`Base directory for this skill: <path>`) telling you to resolve the skill's relative paths
against it. The bundled default is `~/.agents/skills/graph`.

## Branch and worktree layout

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
# The default branch is not always `main`. Resolve it once and use $BASE everywhere below:
# a repo whose default is `master` fails every command that assumes otherwise.
BASE="$(git symbolic-ref -q --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|^origin/||')"
BASE="${BASE:-$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)}"
mkdir -p "$ROOT/.graph-worktrees"
WT="$ROOT/.graph-worktrees/node-{N}"
git worktree add -b feat/node-{N}-{slug} "$WT" "$BASE"
echo "$WT"      # this absolute path goes into the node prompt
```

Nodes commit to `feat/node-{N}-{slug}`. The wave integrates them into `wave-{K}-{slug}` off
the default branch (`$BASE`), and that branch is what gets reviewed and shipped. Remove a finished worktree with
`git worktree remove <abs path>`; keep a failed one for investigation.

## State file and tracker

The checkpoint lives at the repo root and must be ignored as `.graph_state*` — a pattern, so the default `.graph_state.json`, the pre-rename `.graph_state` (still read), a per-run `--state .graph_state-prd015`, and the transient `.tmp` are all covered. Commit that ignore rule before
the first wave: it is a tracked file, so an uncommitted edit would make the Step 4 leak check flag
the orchestrator itself. The planner script owns it — never hand-write it. Its schema:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-07-21T10:30:00Z",
  "task": "Add user auth",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "waves": [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]],
  "current_wave": 1,
  "nodes": {
    "1": { "title": "db schema", "deps": [], "scope": ["internal/db"],
           "type": "backend", "criteria": [], "status": "shipped", "commit": "a7b2b8d" },
    "5": { "title": "integration", "deps": [3, 4], "status": "blocked", "error": "dep #3 failed" }
  }
}
```

Statuses: `pending | in_progress | shipped | failed | blocked | skipped`. `shipped` and
`skipped` are complete; `failed` and `blocked` stall dependents but do not hold a wave open
forever — the orchestrator decides whether to retry, skip or stop.

Render the live dashboard any time (it auto-refreshes every 5 s; a `present` call re-surfaces it
in DSH):

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/render_graph_html.py .graph_state.json graph.html
```

On resume: `python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py show`, ask the user about `failed` nodes
(retry or skip), and continue from `current_wave`.

## Why review and ship are wave-scoped

- A per-node `/review-it` is a **self-review**: the agent that just wrote the code re-reads it
  with the same assumptions, on a diff that may not survive integration. The same tokens buy
  much less signal than one review of the integrated diff by a reader who did not write it.
- A per-node `/ship-it` means **N PRs**: N CI runs, N merges, and N chances for a merge conflict
  to stall a wave that was otherwise finished. One wave PR collapses all three to one.
- The harness documents no policy either way; this placement is a judgement about where the
  tokens and the wall-clock actually go, and it is the reason the node prompt stops at commit.

Wave-scoping has real costs, and the skill pays them down rather than pretending they are absent:

- **One squash commit buries N features**, so reverting one means a manual revert. That is why the
  wave PR carries the per-item evidence table (commit, issue, proving test) — the commits are the
  only handle left after the squash.
- **One review pass over N feature diffs dilutes attention.** That is why Step 4 reviews section by
  section and spends the pass on the seams between nodes, which is where a wave review is actually
  stronger than a per-node one.
- **A stalled node can drag a whole wave.** That is why retry-in-place comes first and why a failed
  node is dropped from the wave branch once its dependents are `blocked`: the siblings are
  independent by construction, so holding them back buys nothing.
- **A bigger wave is a bigger blast radius.** Keep waves at 2–3 nodes when the extra parallelism
  does not buy much; per-node PRs remain the right shape when each feature must be independently
  revertible or reviewed.
