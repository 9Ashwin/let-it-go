# graph — DAG → parallel waves

Turn a task (or PRD / SPEC / issue set) into a directed acyclic graph of work units, layer it
into waves, and implement each wave's independent nodes concurrently by dispatching one fresh
child per node, one git worktree each. Between waves a fan-in barrier integrates, reviews and
ships **once**.

**This skill is guidance, not a script.** The ordering arithmetic — cycle detection, scope
collisions, wave layering, checkpoint transitions — belongs to `scripts/graph_state.py`, which
is tested. Run it and read its summary; do not re-derive the layering by hand.

## When to use it

Use it when the work has **genuine parallelism**: two or more units that do not depend on each
other and do not edit the same logic. That is the whole value — a wave only pays for itself if
the nodes inside it are truly independent.

Do not use it when:

- the whole change fits one context window — just implement it;
- there is one unit, or two that share files — dispatch one fresh child directly, or use the
  **loop-it** skill;
- the units are layered rather than independent (schema → API → UI, each waiting on the last) —
  that is a chain, and `/loop-it` is the right shape;
- you would be spawning a node for something you could finish inline in a few tool calls. Every
  child pays the parent's full prompt, tool schemas and skill catalog for its whole life
  (`references/dsh-runtime.md` explains the cost shape), so a trivial node costs far more than
  it saves.

## The contract: three scopes

| Scope | Does | Does not |
|-------|------|----------|
| **node** | implement, prove with the project's gates, commit on its own branch | push, open a PR, merge, review itself |
| **wave** | leak check, integrate, gates on the integrated tree, **review once**, **ship once** | — |
| **run** | final summary, close out the tracker, re-plan leftovers | — |

Review and ship are wave-scoped on purpose. A per-node `/review-it` is a self-review of a diff
that may not survive integration, and a per-node `/ship-it` means N PRs, N CI runs and N chances
to stall on a merge conflict. The **walkthrough** is wave-scoped for the same reason: it proves
the integrated result. The **PR body and the merge checklist belong to `/ship-it`** — it is their
only producer; the walkthrough feeds it evidence, not a second copy of the body. Per-node PRs
remain available when the user explicitly wants a reviewable PR per node — that is the expensive
mode; say so and confirm before using it.

**Every node still gets an evidence check at fan-in** (Step 4, step 1). That is not a code review:
it asks whether each acceptance criterion can point at an actual observation, before the node's
branch is accepted into the wave. Catching "claims done, has no evidence" there is far cheaper
than catching it after the merge.

## Step 1: Decompose into nodes

Accept a free-form task, a PRD/SPEC, or an existing issue set. Reuse `/to-issues`' rules: one
node per user story, split large stories, merge tiny ones, and give every node real acceptance
criteria.

Write a nodes file — this is the planner's only input:

```json
{
  "task": "Add user auth",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": 1, "title": "db schema", "deps": [], "scope": "internal/db",
     "type": "backend", "criteria": ["migration applies on a fresh database"]},
    {"id": 2, "title": "API handler", "deps": [1], "scope": "internal/api", "type": "backend"}
  ]
}
```

`scope` is the comma-separated set of files/directories the node expects to touch. It is how
the planner detects that two dependency-free nodes are not actually independent.

`criteria` is the node's acceptance checklist, copied into the child's prompt verbatim. It survives a
re-plan either way — with no nodes file the checkpoint is round-tripped whole, and with one the
planner falls back to the checkpoint field by field — but write it here anyway. This file is the
human-authored record of what each node is supposed to do, and it is the one you read when the graph
is being changed; a criterion that lived only in the checkpoint used to vanish on the next `plan`,
and the child was then told to "write them from the issue".

`context` is the orchestrator's briefing for the child: one or two lines per dependency — what it
added, where, and anything this node must know. The child cannot read the earlier nodes'
conversations, so this is the only channel the graph has, and a node dispatched without it starts
by re-deriving facts the graph already knew. Write it here rather than pasting it into a temp copy
of the prompt, where the next dispatch silently drops it.

`hot_files` is the opposite list: shared *wiring* files (a router, a `main`, a route table, a DI
container, a type union) the node **will** touch but that must stay **out** of `scope`, because
listing them there would serialize the whole graph into a chain. The planner does not serialize on
them — it warns when two nodes in one wave declare the same hot file.

That warning exists because "append-only edits merge cleanly" has a premise, and the premise is
**each node edits its own region**. Two nodes appending to one import block, writing one route
table, or extending one type union are not append-only, and they will conflict at integration —
that is not a merge accident, it is the shape of the change. When the warning fires, either
serialize those nodes into different waves, or give one node ownership of the file and let the
others expose a registration hook for it. Treating the file as append-only when it is not is how
a wave ends up resolving the same conflict three times.

## Step 2: Plan, then confirm with the user

`<SKILL_DIR>` is this skill's own directory (absolute) — resolve it from the path the harness
reported when it loaded this skill. The bundled default is `~/.agents/skills/graph`.

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py plan --nodes nodes.json --max-parallel 4
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/render_graph_html.py .graph_state.json graph.html
```

The planner validates (cycles are fatal, phantom and self edges are dropped with warnings),
layers the waves so dependencies and disjoint scopes both hold, writes `.graph_state.json`, and
prints the plan, a Mermaid diagram and the dispatch list for the current wave. It also warns when
two nodes in one wave declare the same hot file.

`--nodes` is needed only for the **first** plan of a graph. Leave it off afterwards and the planner
re-layers from the checkpoint itself: the node table already carries every declarative field a plan
reads (title, deps, scope, hot_files, type, criteria, context, and any branch already recorded), so
the nodes file is required only when the graph itself changes — a new node, a moved dependency. That
matters because the nodes file is the gitignored scratch input, and losing it used to make re-planning
impossible at exactly the moment it is worth most.

**Re-planning mid-run keeps what shipped.** Add `--keep-shipped` when a node turns out to be
already satisfied, a node has to move, or the graph grew: every id that survives keeps its
`status`, `branch`, `commit` and error history, only new ids start pending, and ids you removed
are reported rather than silently dropped. Without the flag a re-plan resets everything to
pending, which is why re-planning used to mean re-recording the shipped nodes by hand.

**Pair it with `--only-pending` once anything has shipped.** Layering is about what runs at the
same time, and a node that shipped weeks ago cannot collide with anything — but by default it still
reserves its files, so every later node that touches them is pushed into a wave of its own. On a
graph that had run most of the way this silently flattened the whole tail into one node per wave.
`--only-pending` frees the scope of `shipped`/`skipped` nodes and keeps it for `in_progress` ones,
which are running right now: a pending node that shares files with one of those is ordered behind
it, because otherwise the shorter of the two dependency chains decides the order and the pending
node gets dispatched into files a child is editing at that moment. Use both flags together —
`--keep-shipped` is what puts the outcomes in the checkpoint for `--only-pending` to read.
Re-plan before a wave whenever nodes have shipped since the last plan; the widest layout is not
the one computed at kickoff.

`--max-parallel` is written into the checkpoint (`max_parallel`), so a later re-plan that omits
the flag reuses it instead of silently re-layering the waves; a re-plan that changes it says so.
The nodes file can carry `"max_parallel": 4` for the same reason — the cap shapes the layout, and
a layout nobody can reproduce is a layout nobody can check.


Keep the plan input out of git along with the checkpoint it produces:
`grep -qxF '.graph_state*' .gitignore || printf 'nodes*.json\n.graph_state*\ngraph*.html\n.graph-worktrees/\n' >> .gitignore`,
then **commit that ignore rule before the first wave**. Step 4's leak check wants a clean shared
checkout, and an uncommitted `.gitignore` edit would make the orchestrator flag itself as the leak.
(If you would rather not commit an ignore rule, put the same lines in the untracked
`.git/info/exclude` instead.)

**The worktrees live inside the repo on purpose.** Under DSH's `workspace-write` sandbox, writing
outside the session's working directory is denied, so a worktree root beside the repo
(`$(dirname "$ROOT")/…`) fails with a sandbox denial that does not read like a path problem.
`$ROOT/.graph-worktrees/` is inside the sandbox in every mode, which is why the ignore rule above
covers it.

All three are wildcards on purpose, and between them they cover every run: `nodes*.json` is the
planner input, `.graph_state*` the checkpoint (the default `.graph_state.json`, the pre-rename
`.graph_state` — still **read**, so an in-flight graph keeps its progress and migrates on its next
write — a per-run `--state .graph_state-prd015`, and the transient `<path>.tmp`), and `graph*.html`
the board. Because they are wildcards, a second run costs nothing extra: give it `--state
.graph_state-prd015` and name its input and output `nodes-prd015.json` / `graph-prd015.html`. The
price is that artifacts have to keep one of those three prefixes — a name outside them needs its own
exact line, which is the churn these patterns exist to remove. `git status --porcelain` after the
first write is the check that nothing slipped through.

Show the user the plan and let them adjust nodes, edges or the concurrency cap **before** any
child starts. Then render and hand over `graph.html`:

```
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/render_graph_html.py .graph_state.json graph.html
```

Be precise about what that file is: **it is a snapshot of the last checkpoint**. The state is
inlined at render time, and `plan`/`set` re-render `graph.html` beside the checkpoint on every
write — that is why there is no manual step to forget (the obligation used to be attached to
closing a wave, and the board sat eight hours stale as soon as the work stopped being waves:
adding nodes, filing issues, deploying). The page reloads itself every 5s, so an open tab follows
those writes; what it cannot show is work between two writes. Run the command above only when you
want the board somewhere else, or to confirm a refresh that reported a failure. A board that
silently shows older work is worse than no board, because the user believes it.

## Step 3: Run a wave

**Pre-flight, once, before the first fan-out** (same spirit as `/loop-it`; any hard failure stops
the run):

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree   # in a repo?
git status --porcelain                # clean tree? (dirty → stash or abort)
git branch --show-current             # on the default branch?
git ls-remote --heads origin          # remote reachable?
gh auth status                        # only if the wave will ship to GitHub
```

Then, for each wave, create one worktree per node, capturing each **absolute** path:

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
# The default branch is not always `main`. Resolve it once and use $BASE everywhere below:
# a repo whose default is `master` fails every command that assumes otherwise.
BASE="$(git symbolic-ref -q --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|^origin/||')"
BASE="${BASE:-$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)}"
mkdir -p "$ROOT/.graph-worktrees"
WT="$ROOT/.graph-worktrees/node-{N}"
git worktree add -b feat/node-{N}-{slug} "$WT" "$BASE"   # `prompt` prints this exact line
```

**Mark every node in this wave `in_progress` before you dispatch it.** Nothing else writes that
status, and the board is the only progress signal the user has:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py set --node {N} --status in_progress
```

Each prompt is self-contained — a fresh child sees none of this conversation. Render it from the
checkpoint rather than hand-writing it:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py prompt --node {N}
```

That fills the worktree path, the branch, the title, the type, the scope, the hot files and the
acceptance criteria straight out of `.graph_state.json`, and prints the `git worktree add` line for the
branch it names. **The branch is the checkpoint's, not the script's:** if a `branch` is recorded
for the node it is used verbatim, and only an unrecorded node gets a name derived from its title —
in which case the header says the name was derived and that the branch does not exist yet. Record
the real name as soon as it exists, especially if it diverges from the derived one — the same
`set` that marked the node `in_progress` takes it:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py set --node {N} --status in_progress --branch {real-branch}
```

Two things are still left for you, and the render says so: the **dependency summaries** (no script
can know what an earlier node actually produced) and anything the issue body adds. Read the
rendered prompt before sending it: the generator removes the transcription errors, not the
judgement.

A deployment may trim a node child's tools — a node needs no skill, because the node prompt
already carries its whole contract, while the full-strength path is what a wave reviewer or a
research child needs. The optional lean-delegation cost lever lives in
`references/lean-subagent.md` and `references/dsh-runtime.md`.

### Dispatch the wave

Hand every rendered prompt to **one `workflow` call per wave** rather than firing off a handful of
bare `subagent` calls. `agent({ schema })` is the only path in DSH that returns a **validated**
object from a child, and the engine — not the model — holds the concurrency cap.

```js
// args: { wave: 1, nodes: [{ id: "3", label: "node 3 — add the parser", prompt: "<rendered>" }] }
const NODE_REPORT = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    node:     { type: "string" },
    status:   { type: "string", enum: ["shipped", "failed", "blocked"] },
    commit:   { type: "string" },
    files:    { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
    gates:    { type: "string" },
    new_work: { type: "string" },
    summary:  { type: "string" },
  },
  required: ["node", "status", "commit", "files", "gates", "new_work", "summary"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

phase(`wave ${args.wave}`);
return await parallel(args.nodes.map((n) => () =>
  agent(n.prompt, { label: n.label, phase: `wave ${args.wave}`, schema: NODE_REPORT })));
```

Two schema details are load-bearing, and both cost a wave to discover the hard way: an `enum`
needs an explicit `type` beside it (a bare `{ enum: [...] }` is rejected as outside the supported
subset, and the whole script dies), and **`summary` is where the prose goes** — a structured child
is told by the runtime to finish with the tool call and *not* with a plain text answer, so anything
the six mechanical keys cannot carry has to have a key of its own or it is lost.

Three properties of that call decide how the rest of the wave is written:

- **A failed node comes back as `null`.** `parallel` degrades a per-item failure to `null` and keeps
  the rest, so the result always has one slot per node; a `null` slot is a node to retry (Step 5) or
  mark `failed`. Hook misuse — a bad option, a tripped cap — throws instead and kills the script,
  which is what you want: it means the dispatch itself is wrong, not the node.
- **A schema miss is `null` too.** A child that finishes without producing the object is
  indistinguishable from one that failed, and needs the same handling.
- **There is no overall timeout.** A wedged wave does not expire: run the workflow in the background
  and `job_kill` it if it stops moving. That is the price of an engine-level concurrency cap, and it
  is why the orchestrator still owns the checkpoint.

The returned object is the node's **own account**. It transcribes straight into the checkpoint,
which is what makes validating it worth the call — but it is **not evidence**. The leak check, the
diffstat against the `files` it claims, and the integrated gates are what verify the wave. A report
whose `files` list disagrees with its diffstat is the cheapest possible catch, and it only works if
you compare rather than trust.

Two facts the node prompt must carry, because **a child gets no working directory of its own**: file
tools resolve relative paths against the **orchestrator's** checkout, and every shell call is a
fresh shell. Both are why the worktree path is passed as an absolute path and every command runs
with the worktree as its working directory (`cd <abs worktree> && …`).

Do not poll a running wave. The `workflow` call returns when the whole wave is done; a bare
`subagent` you started yourself settles with a notice instead. **Audit the children** you started to
see who is still running.

## Step 4: Fan in — barrier, integrate, review, ship

The barrier is **every** node's child having settled. Then, in order:

**A wave of one node has nothing to integrate.** Skip the wave branch and the merge ceremony
for it — review and ship that node's branch directly against the default branch (`$BASE`). The wave exists to combine
nodes; with one node it is pure ceremony.

1. **Leak check, evidence check, then mark.** Two gates before a node is accepted into the wave.

   *Leak check.* `git status --porcelain` on the shared checkout must be clean and each node's
   files must exist only on its branch — that is the evidence the absolute-path discipline held.
   (Untracked files belonging to *another* session are not a leak; a modified *tracked* file is.)
   That is exactly why Step 2 commits the ignore rule up front: an uncommitted `.gitignore` edit
   would make the orchestrator flag itself as the leak.

   *Evidence check.* Walk the node's acceptance criteria and ask, for each one, which actual
   observation proves it — a gate that ran, a command's output, a page, a query. The node's own
   report is not evidence (Step 3), so compare it against the diffstat and the gates you can
   actually see. A criterion with nothing behind it means the node is **not** `shipped`: retry it
   in place (Step 5) or mark it `failed`. Judge evidence, not diff aesthetics; keep the check
   cheap for a node clearly inside the model's reliable range and dig deeper the closer it sits to
   the edge. Any finding must be specific enough to act on without re-investigating — `file:line`
   + cause + what to change; "consider adding tests" is not a finding.

   Then record the outcome with the planner, **including the branch the node actually
   worked on** and **the node's own report** — everything downstream (the merge list below, a
   later re-plan, a rendered prompt) reads it from the checkpoint, so an unrecorded branch falls
   back to a name derived from the title, and an unrecorded report leaves the wave with no
   evidence at all: the workflow call returned the only copy, and once that step is over the
   transcript is not a place anyone audits:
   ```bash
   python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/graph_state.py set --node {N} --status shipped --commit {sha} \
     --branch {branch} \
     --files "{comma-separated files from the report}" \
     --gates "{the commands it ran and their exit codes}" \
     --summary "{what it did and what surprised it}" \
     --new-work "{what it found that the graph does not capture, or none}"
   ```
   It prints whether the wave is still open, and on the last node it prints the fan-in checklist.
   Marking a node `shipped` without `files` / `gates` / `summary` warns, because that row would
   then say the node finished without saying what proved it — and `files` is exactly what step 3's
   diffstat gets compared against.
2. **Integrate and verify the combination, not the parts.** Merge only the nodes that `shipped`
   — a `failed` node's branch is never merged:
   ```bash
   git checkout "$BASE"
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1 && git pull   # only with an upstream
   git checkout -b wave-{K}-{slug}              # skipped when the wave has one node
   git merge --no-ff feat/node-{N}-{slug}      # once per shipped node, using each node's recorded branch
   <the project's gates>                        # e.g. ./run_all.sh, on the integrated tree
   ```
   Every node passing alone while the integration fails is a normal outcome. Fix it here, in the
   wave. If a node failed, see Step 5 — the rest of the wave still ships when nothing in it
   depends on the failure.
3. **Review the wave once, node by node.** Target `git diff "$BASE"...wave-{K}-{slug}` (or the
   single node's branch). Read it as **one section per node**, in planned order, and give the
   *seams* — shared interfaces, wiring/setup files, config and state that two nodes both touch —
   more attention than the nodes' interiors: that is the class of defect a per-node review
   structurally cannot see. The orchestrator reads it inline when it is small — it already holds
   the context, so it is the cheapest reader — and hands it to **one** fresh child when the
   diff is large or independence matters more. Apply `/review-it`'s Review Focus section by
   section, fix what is accepted, re-run the gates. Per-node evidence was already checked in
   step 1, so spend this pass on the seams; never skip it, and never let one feature's section
   absorb the whole pass.
4. **Write the walkthrough, then ship the wave once.** Run the **walkthrough** skill over the
   integrated diff — what changed, what you ran and what it printed, the visual proof of the demo
   path, the risk notes and the manual-acceptance status. It supplies evidence only; the **PR body
   and the merge checklist are `/ship-it`'s output**, produced once there. **ship-it** then opens
   one commit/PR, merges, and closes the issues the wave satisfied. One squash commit buries N
   features, so that body must carry the per-item evidence table (commit, issue, the test that
   proves it, manual-acceptance status) — without it neither you nor the user can audit or revert
   a single feature afterwards.
5. **Update the board — unconditionally.** `set` already wrote each node's outcome, including the
   last node of the wave, so the checkpoint is current. Re-render anyway: the render is what the
   user actually looks at, and a `set` that failed silently, a custom `--state`, or an out-of-band
   edit leaves the file and the page disagreeing.

   ```
   python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/render_graph_html.py .graph_state.json graph.html
   ```

   Re-rendering is the closing act of every wave, not a one-off at plan time: the page is a
   snapshot, so skipping it leaves the user reading the previous wave until they happen to ask.
   (With a custom `--state`, substitute that name here and in every command in this skill.) The
   board derives the wave still in progress from node statuses, so there is no separate
   `current_wave` write to make.
6. Remove finished worktrees (keep failed ones).
7. **Re-plan.** Read each node's `NEW_WORK:` line; if any is not `none`, add the node(s) and
   re-layer the remaining work with the planner before the next wave — `--keep-shipped
   --only-pending` here too, so the nodes that already shipped stop holding their files. Show the
   user the delta.

## Step 5: When a node fails

Retry in place first — **continue that child** with a follow-up that names what failed and what
to fix: it reuses the node's own context instead of paying for a fresh child. If it fails again,
keep its worktree, mark it `failed`, and mark every dependent node `blocked` (the planner prints
them). Reuse `/loop-it`'s error classes from `../loop-it/references/error-recovery.md` rather
than inventing new ones.

**A wave is not all-or-nothing.** Once the failed node's dependents are `blocked`, drop that
node from the wave branch and ship the rest — its siblings are independent by construction, so
making them wait for a re-plan buys nothing. Never merge the failed branch, and never mark it
`shipped` just to keep the wave moving. Offer the user the ladder in order: retry in place, retry
as a fresh node, then drop.

## State file and the live board

`.graph_state.json` is the checkpoint; `graph.html` is a derived view of it — never hand-edit the
HTML, regenerate it. Both stay out of git (Step 2). The schema lives in
`references/dsh-runtime.md`; what matters here is **which action writes which status**, because that
is the one part of the graph no script performs for you. Cycles, scope collisions and wave layering
are computed; the status transitions are yours.

| status | written when | by |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| `pending` | the node is laid out | `plan` |
| `in_progress` | **before** the node's child is dispatched | you |
| `shipped` | its branch survived the leak check and entered the wave's merge list | you |
| `failed` | it exhausted the retry ladder (Step 5) | you |
| `blocked` | a dependency failed; the planner prints the list | you |
| `skipped` | dropped from the graph on a re-plan | you |

Only `plan` and `set` write the checkpoint, and each re-renders `graph.html` beside it. So the board
is exactly as honest as the `set` calls: skip them and the graph still runs, the code still lands,
and the board silently lies in the meantime. Mark `in_progress` at dispatch, not after the child
returns — a wave that is half done then reads as untouched.

On resume (a crash, or a new session): run `graph_state.py show`, re-layer what is left with
`plan --keep-shipped --only-pending` from the same nodes file, leave `shipped`/`skipped` alone, and
ask the user about each `failed` node before retrying it.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Dispatching the wave's children in separate responses | One response, one call per node — separate responses run them one after another. |
| Dispatching without marking the nodes `in_progress` | `set --status in_progress` before each child starts. |
| Rendering the board only at plan time | Re-render at every wave close (Step 4 item 5). |
| Editing in the shared checkout instead of the node's own worktree | One `git worktree` per node, with its absolute path in the prompt. |
| Two dependency-free nodes editing the same logic | List the file in both nodes' `scope` so the planner serializes them; shared wiring goes in `hot_files`. |
| Starting the next wave before every child settled | The fan-in barrier is mandatory. |
| Merging a `failed` node's branch to keep the wave moving | Never; mark its dependents `blocked` and ship the rest. |
| Running `/review-it` or `/ship-it` per node | Review and ship once per wave; per-node PRs only when the user asks for them. |
| Over-decomposing into trivial nodes | Merge tiny units — a node must be worth a child's whole prompt. |

## Safety guards

- **Worktree isolation is mandatory** — two nodes implementing in one checkout corrupt each other.
- **Absolute paths inside a node are mandatory** — the failure mode is silent and it corrupts a wave.
- **Leak check before every merge** — a modified *tracked* file in the shared checkout means a node escaped its worktree; untracked files from another session are not a leak.
- **One review and one ship per wave** — per-node review is self-review; per-node PRs are the expensive mode.
- **Never force-push to the default branch.** Nodes commit to their own branches; the wave ships one PR.
- **Respect the depth budget** — a node must not dispatch children of its own; a node is a leaf.
- **Cap concurrency** (3–4 by default), **prefer waves of 2–3 nodes**, and **keep the child count honest** — the wave is the blast radius of one bad integration, so do trivia inline.
- **Confirm the plan** before the first fan-out, and keep `.graph_state.json` + `graph.html` current.

- `scripts/graph_state.py` (`plan` / `set` / `prompt` / `show`) — validation, layering,
  checkpoints, and the node prompt rendered from them. `set --branch` records where a node
  actually lives; `prompt` prefers that over a name derived from the title.
- `scripts/test_graph_state.py` — the planner's unit tests; run them after any edit to it.
- `scripts/render_graph_html.py [state.json] [graph.html]` — renders the `graph.html`
  dashboard. `--state` / `--out` name the same two values. It inlines the checkpoint, so the page
  is a snapshot of when it ran; `plan` and `set` invoke it on every write, so the board is current
  without anyone remembering to refresh it. `scripts/test_render_graph_html.py` covers it; run it
  after any edit.
