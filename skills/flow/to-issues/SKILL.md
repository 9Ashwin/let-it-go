# to-issues — PRD/SPEC to Issues

Decompose a PRD and/or technical SPEC into small, **independently demoable** Issues, each sized to fit a single fresh context window, then create them in your chosen platform. Works standalone — you don't need to have run `/prd` first.

Every Issue this skill produces is **agent-ready by construction**: a fresh session that has never seen your PRD/SPEC can pick it up and finish it.

---

## Core principle: tracer bullets, not layers

This is the rule that matters most, and the one models break most often.

- A **horizontal** slice ships one layer of the change (all the schema in one ticket, all the API in another, all the UI in a third). Nothing works until every layer lands, and each ticket's acceptance criteria have to reach into work another ticket owns. This is the default the model falls into — **avoid it.**
- A **vertical** slice — the *tracer bullet* — ships one thin but complete path through every layer at once (schema + API + UI + tests for a single narrow behaviour). It is verifiable alone the moment it lands, and it owns everything it grades.

**The test for every Issue: "What can I demo when this is done?"** If the answer is a layer ("the database has a priority column") rather than a behaviour ("a user can set a task's priority and see it persist"), it is a horizontal slice — re-slice it.

**Sizing floor:** if the whole change fits in one context window, you don't need Issues at all. Say so and implement it directly — starting a long-running autonomous objective is something only the human can do, so either do the work inline or tell the user to start that objective themselves.

**Consumption contract:** a **fresh child** does NOT see this conversation, so an Issue body must be self-contained. That is the "agent-ready by construction" rule above, now enforced by the runtime instead of by convention. A **forked child** inherits context — use it only for follow-ups, never as a substitute for a well-written Issue.

> **The Issue body is the contract.** There is no separate SPEC document to keep in context: goal, non-goals, acceptance criteria, external boundary, required evidence, definition of done and open questions all live in the body, so a fresh child can act on it without this conversation. Keep those fields honest — a criterion with no observation that would prove it is not a criterion.

## The Job

1. **Locate input** — find a PRD or SPEC file (auto-detect or user-specified)
2. **Find prefactoring** — surface "make the change easy, then make the easy change" work and order it first
3. **Decompose into vertical Issues** — break behaviour into tracer-bullet tickets with blocking edges
4. **Quiz the user** — present the numbered list and push on granularity, edges, and demo paths before publishing
5. **Choose platform** — GitHub / Local
6. **Create Issues** — blockers first, with native blocking links, then print summary

---

## Step 1: Locate Input

Find the input document:

```
What should I base the Issues on?

A. Auto-detect: scan tasks/ for recent PRDs and SPECs
B. Specific PRD file (e.g., tasks/prd-priority-system.md)
C. Specific SPEC file (e.g., tasks/spec-priority-system.md)
D. Both PRD and SPEC (best: PRD for requirements, SPEC for technical contracts)
E. Paste requirements directly
```

If auto-detecting, list available files and let the user choose.

If both PRD and SPEC are available, use the SPEC's Section 10.2 (Issue Mapping) as the primary guide, supplemented by PRD's User Stories. If only PRD is available, generate Issues directly from User Stories.

---

## Step 2: Find Prefactoring First

Before slicing features, look for **prefactoring**: mechanical groundwork that makes the feature Issues small and safe — extracting a shared helper, widening a type, adding a seam, moving a file. Order this work **first**, as its own Issue(s), so the feature tickets that depend on it stay thin.

If you find none, skip this step. Don't invent busywork.

---

## Step 3: Decompose into Vertical Issues

Generate the Issue list. Rules:

- **Each Issue is a tracer bullet** — a narrow, complete, demoable path through every layer it touches. Not "the backend for X"; rather "X, end to end, for one case."
- **Each Issue fits one fresh context window** — a single agent session completes it without needing you in the room.
- **Split by behaviour, not by layer** — if a User Story is large, split it into 2-3 *narrower behaviours*, each still vertical, with explicit blocking edges. Never split it into a backend ticket and a frontend ticket.
- **Merge tiny stories** — 1-2 trivial criteria that don't stand alone as a demo should merge into a related Issue.
- **Declare blocking edges explicitly** — every Issue lists what must finish before it can start. These edges are the point of the artifact.
- **Number Issues in dependency order** — blockers first, so an implementer (or the tracker) always has a valid frontier to start from.
- **If SPEC is available** — enrich each Issue with SPEC references (API contracts, data model sections, error handling). But keep file paths and line numbers *out* of the body — they rot; describe behaviour and contracts instead.

**Falsifiable acceptance criteria.** For each criterion, name the observation that would show it *false*, and confirm it would fail at the commit the implementer starts from. Reject three shapes: a criterion already true at the base commit, one that can only be satisfied by work another Issue owns, and one that merely restates the request. A vertical slice delivers behaviour that didn't exist before, so it should be red at the base commit by construction.

**Issue format:**

```
Issue #N: [Title — a behaviour, not a layer]
---
Goal: [What behaviour this delivers, end to end, and why]
Non-goals: [What this explicitly does not do — the scope fence]
Demo path: [The one thing you can show working when this lands]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Falsifiable — names an observation that fails at the base commit]
- [ ] ...
Evidence required: [For each criterion, the observation that proves it — test name, command, page, query. Never "tests pass".]
External boundary: [What must be real for this to count — running service, database, third-party API, human check. "None" if the change is local.]
Definition of done: [Gates green + every criterion carries evidence + the demo path was actually run]
Open questions: [Unresolved items that must not be silently guessed — or None]
Blocked by: [None / Issue #X, #Y]
Priority: [high / medium / low]
```

**Contract quality checks** — run these before publishing anything:

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion maps to an **observable** piece of evidence, not "tests pass"
- [ ] No `TBD` / `TODO` left — resolve it now or move it to Open questions
- [ ] Failure paths have a place in the criteria; not only the happy path
- [ ] Non-goals are stated, or the implementation will expand scope on its own
- [ ] The external boundary says what must be *real* to count — a local fake only proves the local contract
- [ ] Definition of done includes "the demo path was actually run", not "the code looks right"

Anti-patterns: restating the request in different words as a criterion; writing an algorithm section for CRUD with no special logic; choosing technology without reading what the project already uses; listing behaviour that is already true at the base commit.

---

## Step 4: Quiz the User (do not skip)

Present the breakdown as a numbered list and **quiz** the user before publishing anything. Over-decomposition and accidental horizontal slicing are the two most common failures — this step catches both.

```
📋 Generated N Issues from [PRD/SPEC], in dependency order:

#1: Extract task-mutation helper (prefactoring) — Blocked by: none
#2: A user can set a task's priority and see it persist — Blocked by: #1
    demo: open a task, pick High, reload, still High
#3: A user can filter the task list to one priority — Blocked by: #2
    demo: select High, list shows only High tasks
#4: A user can sort the task list by priority — Blocked by: #2
    demo: click Sort, tasks reorder High→Low

Review before I create anything:
- Granularity: too fine? "merge #3 and #4". Too coarse? "split #2".
- Demo path: any Issue whose demo is a layer, not a behaviour, is mis-sliced — tell me.
- Edges: are the "Blocked by" links real? Any missing or spurious?
- Adjust: "change #2 priority to high", "add an issue for a priority badge"
- Confirm: reply OK to proceed
```

Wait for confirmation before creating any Issues.

---

## Step 5: Choose Creation Mode

```
Choose where to create these Issues:

A. GitHub (via gh CLI, with native blocking links and optional sub-issues)
B. Local (one markdown file per Issue, dependency-ordered)

Your choice:
```

---

## Step 6: Mode-Specific Creation

### Mode A: GitHub

**Prerequisites:** `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, v2.94+ for `--parent` / `--blocked-by`.

**Create blockers first** so their Issue numbers exist before any Issue that depends on them. Capture each returned number.

**Actions:**
1. For each Issue, in dependency order:
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "[Title]" \
     --body "[Goal + Non-goals + Demo path + Acceptance Criteria + Evidence required + External boundary + Definition of done + Open questions]" \
     --label "priority: [priority]" \
     --blocked-by [comma-separated blocker numbers, if any] \
     --parent [spec issue number, if creating as sub-issues]
   ```
   - Use native `--blocked-by` for edges. Only fall back to a "Blocked by #X" line in the body if the tracker rejects the flag.
   - If the SPEC lives in a GitHub issue, pass `--parent <spec_issue>` so these become sub-issues of it. To wire a parent after the fact: `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <n>`.
2. If labels don't exist, create them first or skip the `--label` flag.
3. Report created Issue numbers and URLs.

### Mode B: Local

**Ask user:**
```
Where should I save the Issue files? (default: .autoresearch/issues/[feature-slug])
```

**Actions:**
1. Create the feature folder with `mkdir -p` if it doesn't exist. One folder per feature keeps parallel agents from racing on a shared file.
2. For each Issue, in **dependency order**, save `NN-[slug].md` (zero-padded, `NN` is a real ticket ID so a dispatcher can name it when handing the Issue to a fresh child or a worktree branch):
   ```markdown
   # [Title — a behaviour]

   ## Goal
   [What behaviour this delivers, end to end, and why]

   ## Non-goals
   [What this explicitly does not do]

   ## Demo path
   [The one thing you can show working when this lands]

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] [Falsifiable criterion 1]
   - [ ] [Falsifiable criterion 2]

   ## Evidence required
   [Per criterion: the observation that proves it — test name, command, page, query]

   ## External boundary
   [What must be real for this to count; "None" if local]

   ## Definition of done
   [Gates green + every criterion carries evidence + the demo path was run]

   ## Open questions
   [Unresolved items — or None]

   ## Blocked by
   [None / #NN, #NN]

   ## Priority
   [high / medium / low]
   ```
3. Report created file paths in dependency order.

## The wide-refactor exception

One shape breaks the tracer-bullet rule: a **wide refactor** — a single mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose blast radius fans across the whole codebase, so one edit breaks thousands of call sites and no vertical slice can land green.

Sequence it as **expand → migrate → contract** instead:

- **Expand** — add the new form beside the old, so nothing breaks. One Issue.
- **Migrate** — move call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), one Issue per batch, each **blocked by** the expand. CI stays green because the old form still exists.
- **Contract** — delete the old form once no caller remains, in an Issue **blocked by every migrate batch**.

Where even the batches can't stay green alone, have them share an integration branch and all block a final **integrate-and-verify** Issue; green is promised only there.

---

## Step 7: Summary Report

```
✅ Issue creation complete!

Source: [PRD/SPEC path]
Mode: [GitHub / Local]
Issues created: N (in dependency order)

#  | Title (behaviour)                        | Blocked by | Identifier
---|------------------------------------------|------------|------------
1  | Extract task-mutation helper             | —          | #42 / 01-*.md
2  | Set & persist task priority              | #1         | #43 / 02-*.md
3  | Filter task list by priority             | #2         | #44 / 03-*.md
4  | Sort task list by priority               | #2         | #45 / 04-*.md

Frontier (no open blockers, start now): #1
```

Then tell the user **how to dispatch** — the dependency shape decides it:

| Shape | How to run it |
|-------|---------------|
| One Issue, right now | a **fresh child** with the Issue body as a self-contained prompt — or just implement it inline |
| Sequential batch | `/loop-it` — checkpointed, one Issue at a time |
| Genuinely parallel frontier (no shared file scope) | `/graph` — DAG → waves → one worktree per node, fan-in barrier between waves |
| One long objective that should keep running on its own | the **human** starts the objective in their client; the model cannot start it for them |
| Large model-driven orchestration | only when the user explicitly asks for it |

Two caveats to state out loud:

- A long-running objective may not auto-close the ticket — update its state yourself when done.
- Parallel dispatch is only safe when the frontier's Issues do **not** edit the same files. `/graph` enforces that with one worktree per node plus a fan-in barrier; if scopes overlap, run those Issues sequentially instead.

DSH tool names for the "One Issue, right now" row, and how DSH discovers and invokes this skill, are in [`references/dsh-runtime.md`](references/dsh-runtime.md).

---

## It's working if

- Every Issue answers "what can I demo when this is done?" — and the answer is a behaviour, not a layer.
- The list came back numbered with a real "Blocked by" line on each, before anything was published.
- The Issue at the top has no blockers and can be started immediately.
- No Issue body carries a file path or line number (except a snippet a prototype produced).
- Each Issue reads like something a fresh session could finish without you in the room.
- Prefactoring, where any was found, sits at the front of the order — not mixed into feature Issues.
- Every acceptance criterion names an observation that fails at the base commit.

---

## Edge Cases & Fallback

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Whole change fits one context window | Say so; skip Issues, implement it inline (or have the human start a long-running objective) |
| No PRD/SPEC found in tasks/ | Ask user to provide file path or paste requirements |
| PRD has no User Stories | Derive Issues from Functional Requirements instead |
| SPEC has Issue Mapping (Section 10.2) | Use it as primary source, cross-reference with PRD |
| Model produced one-per-layer Issues | Catch at the quiz: any Issue whose demo is a layer gets re-sliced vertically |
| Model over-decomposed (12 tickets for a 3-line change) | Quiz step: ask to merge; if the whole thing fits one window, skip Issues |
| Wide mechanical refactor | Use the expand → migrate → contract sequence above |
| `gh` too old for `--blocked-by` / `--parent` | Fall back to "Blocked by" body line; suggest upgrading gh to v2.94+ |
| `gh` CLI not authenticated for GitHub mode | Show error, suggest `gh auth login`, offer to switch to Local mode |
| Issue folder does not exist for Local mode | Auto-create per-feature folder |
| Issue frontier is genuinely parallel | Recommend `/graph` (worktree per node + fan-in barrier); keep `/loop-it` for serial safety |
| User declines Issue creation | Print the dependency-ordered list as a text summary for manual creation later |

## Relationship to Other Skills

```
/prd  →  /to-issues ─┬─→ /loop-it  (serial: one Issue at a time)
 │            │        └─→ /graph    (parallel: whole wave at once)
 │ Requirements│  Vertical        │
 │  (what)     │  tickets         │  Implementation (code)
```

- **/prd** — produces the PRD (input to this skill); optional for a small change that is already well specified
- **/to-issues** — produces the vertically-sliced Issues, each carrying its own contract block (this skill)
- **/loop-it** — implements Issues sequentially with checkpoint/resume
- **/graph** — implements the dependency graph in parallel waves, one worktree per node
- **/goal** — a human-facing client command for a persisted objective with autonomous rounds. Its gate is authority, not wording: `create_goal` runs only in a direct top-level human turn, so a subagent cannot mint one — but when the human hands over a long-running batch, creating the goal is the designed behaviour and is what keeps the session working between turns
